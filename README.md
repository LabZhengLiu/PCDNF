 ## :bulb: Introduction
MeshTGV is an efficient numerical framework to discretize TGV over triangular meshes.
Based on this discretization, a vectorial TGV regularization model is proposed to restore the face normal field. Then, we introduce an efficient and effective algorithm to solve the optimization problem.

The code will be released soon.
